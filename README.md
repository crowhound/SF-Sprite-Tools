# Pre-Alpha Stage Disclaimer
Please note this package is currently in the pre-alpha stages. Somethings might get moved, renamed, pushed into a new namespace or have the accessor type be changed.
Once pre-alpha three comes around this should not be a worry though. 

# Important for proper installation.

The SF-Sprite-Tools package needs the SF-UI-Elements and the SF-Utilities package installed first. 
Note they are currently in the Shatter Fantasy Organization GitHub repo that I will use in the future for 


Before the release of the full alpha one I am adding functionality to just install the SF Sprite Tools and it will auto pull in the other two packages.
For now though follow the steps below to add the other two packages first manually adding them before installing the Sf Sprite Tools package. 
They have a lot of helper functions meant to make a lot of things simplier for editor tool making, simplifying math functions for Vector2D/3D collections, and graphics rendering for editor windows including scene view.

To install the SF UI Elements and SF Utilities packages you can install the packages with the two following Git URLs inside of Unity's package manager.
If you haven't used a Git URL before to install packages from GitHub directly into Unity you can read the following page information for initial set up.

TLDR: Basically have git on your computer than use the in Unity Editor Package Manager install button that has a plus icon in the top left of the package manager tab.
Choose the install package from git URL option and place the Git URL of the packages below into it.
https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html


### SF-UI-Elements package Git URL
https://github.com/Shatter-Fantasy/SF-UI-Elements.git

### SF-Utilities package Git URL
https://github.com/Shatter-Fantasy/SF-Utilities.git

When both those are installed you can than install the SF Sprite Editor with the following Git URL.
https://github.com/crowhound/SF-Sprite-Tools.git

You are than good to go. Due note I will be adding an automatic system for installing the proper dependicies soon for the SF Sprite Tools package.
Meaning before alpha one full release you will be able to just install the SF Sprite Tools package and it will automatically install the other two for you.
